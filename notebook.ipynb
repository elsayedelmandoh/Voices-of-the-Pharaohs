    "# Abstract:\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Voices of the Pharaohs\" is a groundbreaking project developed for the 8th International Competition of the Military Technical College (AIC-2), focusing on Arabic Speech Recognition (ASR) specifically designed for the Egyptian dialect. This competition entry explores innovative techniques to tackle challenges in ASR, particularly when dealing with noisy environments and overlapping speech.\n",
    "\n",
    "To achieve high accuracy in Word Error Rate (WER) and Diarization Error Rate (DER), our team employs Transformer-based models, such as SpeechT5 and Multilingual Speech (MMS), known for their ability to capture long-range dependencies and contextual relationships within speech data. This project also uses Python libraries like PyDub for audio processing and SpeechRecognition for converting speech to text, allowing us to refine our datasets and improve system performance in complex audio scenarios.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our curated dataset comprises over 100 hours of Egyptian Arabic speech, representing various contexts and speakers. A key innovation in this project is the inclusion of noise modeling and data augmentation strategies to mimic real-world conditions, enhancing the robustness and accuracy of our ASR system. Additionally, we developed a multi-speaker diarization approach to distinguish overlapping voices, utilizing the strengths of Transformer-based models to improve accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of our project is to create an ASR system that is resilient to acoustic disruptions and adaptable to varying dialects. By emphasizing creativity and adaptability, we aim to transform speech recognition technologies in the Arab world, providing a solution that integrates seamlessly into daily life.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our project seeks not only to win the competition but also to inspire a new era in Arabic Speech Recognition. By bringing the \"Voices of the Pharaohs\" to life, we aim to honor Egypt's rich linguistic heritage while embracing the technological possibilities of the future."
